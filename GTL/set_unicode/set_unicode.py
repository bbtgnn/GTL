### UNICODE DICTIONARY CREATION

# Creating empty dictionary that will store unicode values:
# {"glyph name" : "glyph unicode value (expressed as hex string)"}
unicodes_dict = {}

# Getting reference to the file containing Unicode definitions
module_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

# Updating dictionary with definitions from Adobe
with open(txt_path, "r") as txt_file:

    # Extracting single lines from txt
    txt_lines = txt_file.read().splitlines()

    # Iterating over lines:
    for line in txt_lines:

        # Ignoring comments
        if FILE_CHAR_COMMENT not in line:

### FUNCTIONS

# This function takes a glyph as argument and returns the same glyph with unicode set correctly (hex)

# Glyph -> Glyph
def set_unicode(gly):

    global private_use_count

    # If there's a point in glyph name it means it's a glyph meant for an opentype feature.
    # These glyphs do not have a unicode value (because they reference the original glyph) so:
    if "." in gly.name:
        pass

    # If glyph name is in the dictionary
    elif gly.name in unicodes_dict.keys():
        # We set its unicode value to the matching one
        gly.unicode = unicodes_dict[gly.name]

    # If glyph name is in format "uniXXXX"
    elif "uni" in gly.name:
        gly.unicode = hex(int(gly.name.replace("uni", ""), 16))

    # If there's no matching value
    else:
        # We go with private use area
        gly.unicode = hex(int("F0000", 16) + private_use_count)
        private_use_count += 1
