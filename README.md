# GTL
GTL (or Generatore Tipografico di Libert√†) is a Python set of libraries for the creation of generative fonts.<br />
Most important thing: credits to [Daniele Capo](http://www.danielecapo.com/). He had the original idea about this project - mine is a further development.
<br />
<br />

## Install guide
GTL requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.4 or later.

### 1. Virtual Environment creation
First of all, it is strongly recommended to create a Python Virtual Enviroment for the installation of all the needed libraries.

Create a folder where you want (e.g. I usually store all my environments in ```Documents/PythonEnvironments/```).

Then open to the terminal and input
```
# (change <DIR> with the path of your folder)
python3 -m venv <DIR>
```
to create the virtual environment.<br />
To activate it run
```
# On macOS
source <DIR>/bin/activate

# On Windows
<DIR>\Scripts\activate
```
(To exit from the environment, anytime, just enter ```deactivate```.)

### 2. Installing fontParts
[FontParts](https://fontparts.readthedocs.io/) is the core library over which the GTL has been built. To install it (while the virtual environment is active) type in terminal
```
pip install fontParts==0.8.7
```
FontParts is still in development, and newer version are already out. For the moment, the GTL has been tested only on the 0.8.7 version.

### 3. Setting up the workspace
Download the master folder anywhere and you're ready to start!
